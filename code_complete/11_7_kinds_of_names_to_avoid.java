// good naming principles
// 1) fully and accurately describe the object
// 2) refer to real-world problem rather than to programming-language solution
//    ex. use Count/Index, not Num (too generic)
//        named constants are named for abstract entities they represent, not numbers they refer to
// 3) enumerated-type names include a prefix or suffix that indicates the category
//    ex. named constants: COLOR_RED, COLOR_GREEN, COLOR_BLUE, etc.
//        class RtGithub, RtRepos, RtRepo, etc. (Rt stands for Restful)
//        class StSender, StSubject, StReceient, etc. (St stands for Stamp) 
//        class EnPlain, EnHTML, EnBinary, etc. (En stands for Enclosure)
// 4) naming convention
//    a) distinguish among local, class, and global data
//    b) distinguish among type names, named constants, enumerated types, and variables
//    c) identify input-only parameters to routines
// 5) Short Names
//    a) avoid compound names
//    b) all words abbreviated consistently
